CLI program that applies Instagram-like simplistic filters to .bmp photos.
PROGRAM WIL ONLY WORK WITH 24-bit BMP FILES!

Usage: ./filter -x file.bmp out.bmp
(substitute -x with -g for grayscale, -s for sepia, -r for reflection, -b for blur;
file.bmp should be replaced with the name of your input file and out.bmp with the name of the final output.)
